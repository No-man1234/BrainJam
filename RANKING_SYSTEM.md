# BrainJam Arena Ranking System

## How the Ranking System Works

The BrainJam Arena uses a **rating-based ranking system** where users advance through military-inspired ranks based on their coding performance.

### 🏆 Rank Structure

| 🏅 **Algorithm Captain** | 1800 - 2199 | Excel in competitive programming |
| 🥇 **Legendary General** | 2200+ | Elite-level programming mastery |

### 📊 How Rating Changes
